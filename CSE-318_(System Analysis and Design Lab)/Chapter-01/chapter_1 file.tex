\section{Audience}

\begin{itemize}
  \item With this system, users can easily make money         transactions.
  \item In addition, through this system, anyone can bring their money from a Direct card to the account.
  \item Also, here, we have used a medium through which users can easily add their money at any time.
  \item Users can easily pay their bills, such as electricity, water, gas, they can pay any bill. In addition, the admin can add any user if they have any outstanding bills.
  \item Users can easily donate anywhere. Here they can pay even if they hide their identities.
  \item Users will be able to withdraw money at any time and will be able to withdraw cash very carefully. Here the user's identity is verified in different ways so that the money does not reach the rogue user.
  \item The student will be able to open an account in our banking system. No problem. We don't need any passport or sleep card to open an account here.
  \item Student are also transfer any cash without any problem.
\end{itemize}


\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Today our world is in tune with modernity and if we want to keep pace with this we have to be with it. Now we have this digital system so that people can carry their money without any worries.
\item We have taken this kind of project because many people open bank accounts without understanding much. They face a lot of difficulties with money, so they often give money to another account.
\item In addition, it is taken by us so that any user can use this application very easily.
\item A unique advantage here is that those who want to work with digital money have done it very nicely in this project. As a result, they can easily buy this money with money. And they can easily see the value of it.
\item We are adding another feature here that allows users to easily add money from their digital wallets, such as bKash, Cash, Way, Rocket, and MasterCard, which is not the case with many banks.
\item Apart from this, students in our country cannot open an account without their NID cards. As a result, they cannot accumulate their savings. But in our banking service, a student can open an account with their ID card. And he can accept all kinds of services.
\item Many banks charge a fee to pay any bill, but we do not capture any charges in this system. They can exchange money completely free of charge.

\end{itemize}


\section{Human Requirement}
Human needs are an important part of our software, through which we can catch the problems of our software, and our primary objective is to satisfy the users with it. We have some problems with this system.

\begin{itemize}
\item For the user's safety, we are looking at the issue OTP system with Email.
\item For this security, we will verify the user's email when he first registers in this system.
\item We will send this OTP in the mail when the user transfers money, and it will do so when he gives it for verification. Yes, this user is the actual owner.
\item Also, since Crypto-Currency will be bought through our system, so a wallet is required for this.
\item We will make this wallet with registration so that the user does not have to do it separately.
\item The wallet will show how much money the user has bought dollars and how many Crypto-Currency dollars he has bought.

\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Analyzing System Need}
We need to fix this from our admin to solve these problems so that users do not have any problems.
\begin{itemize}
\item We will create a method in the system through which this issue will go directly to the user's OTP.
\item We need to create a database here that will keep a record of how many transactions we have done and the process it has.
\item Buy Crypto-Currency, there will be a wallet, there we will have all the transaction records, and this record will be in the database.
\item To see all these types of work, we need to make two options in admin: wallet and email verification.
\item Perhaps we can solve the problem by creating this panel.

\end{itemize}

\section{Implementing \& Evaluating the System}
Lastly, we will let our users know how our system will work, and we will get to know our system better through some evaluations of whether there are any locks in our system through this evaluation.The users of our system are usually students, teachers, housewives, and working people. The primary purpose is to make it easier for them to transact.
